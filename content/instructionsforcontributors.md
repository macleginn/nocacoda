## Informal instructions for language consultants

Contributor’s goal is to provide **adequate** translations of stimulus sentences and to identify **nominal causal markers** employed (if any).

Main **adequateness** criteria are semantic **precision** (the same meaning as in the stimulus sentence) and **naturalness**. Equivalents that fail to meet these criteria do not make their way into the database (but can be mentioned in comments).

Glosses should be provided in a separate line (no alignment needed). Grammatical labels must be in the upper case (ERG, PST, etc.).

If the sentence obtained is semantically different from the questionnaire stimulus, the actual back translation of the sentence obtained must be provided.

Alternative translational equivalents are welcome. If a given stimulus sentence has more than one equivalent, one of the equivalents must be marked as “main” (other equivalents will be marked “alternate”) based on their naturalness / frequency.
