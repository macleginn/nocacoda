# Welcome to NoCaCoDa: Nominal Causal Constructions Database

NoCaCoDa is a typological database of nominal causal constructions. Nominal causal constructions are constructions where 
the causing event is syntactically represented by a noun phrase, as in *The woman woke up from \[the noise\]* or *The 
woman can’t fall asleep because of \[the mosquitoes\]*. The database makes it possible to explore the ways in which 
different nominal causal markers, such as English *from* and *because of* in the examples above, are distributed over 
various causal contexts. As of {{ this_year }}, the database covers {{ n_languages }} languages, primarily from Northern 
Eurasia. The data have been collected using a [questionnaire]({{ questionnaire }}) containing 54 stimulus sentences. 
These stimulus sentences capture various semantic subtypes of nominal causal constructions.

## How to use NoCaCoDa

You can browse NoCaCoDa by [stimulus sentence]({{ sentences }}) (e.g., in case you are interested in the ways indirect 
external causes are encoded across languages) or by [language]({{ languages }}) (e.g., in case you are interested in the 
ways in which the nominal causal meaning is conveyed in a specific language). Besides, you can 
[take an overview]({{ data_overview }}) of the data in your browser or search the whole database as an extended 
[spreadsheet]({{ spreadsheet }}). In order to properly interpret the tags used in the database, you can consult
